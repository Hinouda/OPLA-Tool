### Step 4: Commit changes
To clone run the command in the terminal: git clone copied_link

Open the project link on github, and if it is open, refresh the page.

## Very important notes, read carefully
When submitting your pull request, you will be sending your changes to the official version of the project, so keep in mind that your version must have the following prerequisites:
- The code must be clean, and it cannot be duplicated;
- You will be responsible for your code. As much as there is a pull request reviewer evaluating your code, it is not the responsibility of the reviewer to test the entire tool for implementation failures. The same, will review your code and tests, seeking the proper functioning of the tool, but any problem that occurs related to your code, is linked to your github account.
- Tests created in Junit are essential to validate the correctness of your code, if someone in the future changes something that impacts their implementation, the tests will block the execution of the project;
- The use of the Intellij ide is recommended, as it offers several features in relation to Netbeans. It is possible to use the community version or the student version;
- Do not change the changelog and README.md without first informing the reviewers;
- When creating the pull request, add comments that reflect exactly what was done in the tool. The same will be used by the reviewer when updating the changelog.
